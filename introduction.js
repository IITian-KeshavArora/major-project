// We will create our website like airbnb.co.in which is a hotel renting app for tourists.
// This project is divided into 3 phases.

// In Phase 1: we will setup basic database and CRUD Operations for our web app.
//     MODEL : Listing
//     It contains: title, description, image, price, location and country of the renting house.

// as we know, that we are going to create alot of models in this web application, so we will dedicate
// a folder of models for the required list of models.


// Now IN phase-2 of our project, we will Style our website accordingly to look it better.
